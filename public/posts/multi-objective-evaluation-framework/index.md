The evaluation of fairness models in Machine Learning involves complex challenges, such as defining appropriate metrics, balancing trade-offs between utility and fairness, and there are still gaps in this stage. This work presents a novel multi-objective evaluation framework that enables the analysis of utility-fairness trade-offs in Machine Learning systems. The framework was developed using criteria from Multi-Objective Optimization that collect comprehensive information regarding this complex evaluation task. The assessment of multiple Machine Learning systems is summarized, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in a straightforward manner through a radar chart and a measurement table encompassing various aspects such as convergence, system capacity, and diversity. The framework's compact representation of performance facilitates the comparative analysis of different Machine Learning strategies for decision-makers, in real-world applications, with single or multiple fairness requirements. The framework is model-agnostic and flexible to be adapted to any kind of Machine Learning systems, that is, black- or white-box, any kind and quantity of evaluation metrics, including multidimensional fairness criteria. The functionality and effectiveness of the proposed framework is shown with different simulations, and an empirical study conducted on a real-world dataset with various Machine Learning systems.
